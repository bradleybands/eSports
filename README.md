Information System (e.g. student information system, customer information system, employee information system, etc.)
Create an information system that stores information about relevant entities (e.g. a student information system will store information about students). The information system must support standard functionality like being able to enter information about a new entity, being able to look up information about a given entity, and being able to delete information about a given entity, but it must also have specialized functionality relevant to the specific information system being implemented (e.g. with a student information system, you may wish to be able to display an alphabetical list of all students in a given class, or list all students with GPAs above a certain value). While your programme is running, the information must be stored using appropriate data structures to ensure efficient implementation of the functionality supported by your information system. When the programme exits, data should be written to a file so that it can be read in next time the

programme starts. In that manner, information is persisted between runs of the programme.
